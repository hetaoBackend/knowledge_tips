<h2 id="build-the-operator-image">Build the operator Image</h2>
<p>We believe the best practice is to build a new Operator for each Chart. This can allow for more native feeling Kubernetes APIs and flexibility if you ever want to write a fully-fledged Operator in Go, migrating away from a Helm-based Operator. The first step is to embed your chart, Kubernates API Group, and Kind into the Operator’s container image. This can be rather simple. Build the Dockerfile and push it to your registry.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-the-application">Deploy the Application</h2>
<p>Before deploying an instance of our application, we need to register our CRD with Kubernetes and deploy our Operator.<br>
if you’re developing your own operator, use the Kubernetes manifests as a starting point. These manifests must be customized in order to contain all the metadata about your new application. Some content is optional, such as an icon, but some content is required.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-helm-versus-a-helm-operator-running">Comparing Helm versus a Helm Operator Running</h2>
<p>Helm with an Operator is useful because any changes to your custom resources can be picked up immediately. No longer should you have to run Helm CLI commands to modify your application due to the removal of Tiller from the cluster.<br>
The Helm Operator is designed to excel at stateless applications because changes should be applied to the Kubernetes objects that are generated as part of the chart. This sounds limiting, but can be sufficient for a surprising amount of use-cases as shown by the proliferation of Helm charts by the Kubernetes community.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-a-helm-operator-vs-go-operator">Comparing a Helm Operator vs Go Operator</h2>
<p>A powerful feature of an Operator is to enable the desired state to be reflected in your application. As your application gets more complicated and has more components, detecting these changes can be harder for a human, but easier for a computer.<br>
The Helm Operator is designed to be simple: it listens for changes to your custom resources and pushes that configuration down to the objects via the chart and the templated values. Because this action is top down, the Operator is not taking a deep look at each individual object field, such as the labels on a specific Pod or a value within a ConfigMap.If one of these is changed manually, the Operator should not overwrite that value with the desired state until the next time the custom resource is changed. Most of the time this should not be an issue, and can be controlled with an RBAC policy.<br>
Complex distributed systems use Kubernetes primitives and certain changes, such as removing labels or changing label selectors, can have disastrous effects on the operation of an app. A Go Operator, built using the Operator SDK, is written with a programming language at your disposal, to help power deeper introspection into not just the custom resource, but the Pods, Services, Deployments and ConfigMaps that make up your app. As an Operator author, you can check how any field from your desired state matches with the running configuration and reset it as part of the Operator’s reconciliation loop. A Go Operator can quickly revert change that is core to the operation of the application.</p>
